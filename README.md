# Request Response Cycle, APIs, and Postman Lab

You will be working with a free API of your choice for this lab.

## Getting Started

1. Choose an API that has no auth and no CORS from the following list: [public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
1. Write your answers in this README.md file. Do not delete the questions. Write your answers after the `>`. If you need to write more than one paragraph, add more `>`.

## Instructions

Do your best to answer the questions with specific details when required fully. Writing about code clearly and thoroughly is a critical skill to practice. 

- Which one did you choose? Provide the name and base URL

> https://freeforexapi.com/Home/Api

- What purpose is this API for (education/fun and games/information/etc.)?

> The purpose of this API is for Currency exchange information

- What is the URL of the documentation?

> https://freeforexapi.com/Home/Api

- What is the full URL of one endpoint?

> http://www.freeforexapi.com/api/live

- What is a sample of the data from the endpoint (copy and paste results from Postman, ok to shorten if itâ€™s over 100 lines)? Be sure to wrap your answer in the correct formatting for code/JSON.
