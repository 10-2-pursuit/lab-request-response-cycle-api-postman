# Request Response Cycle, APIs, and Postman Lab

You will be working with a free API of your choice for this lab.

## Getting Started

1. Choose an API that has no auth and no CORS from the following list: [public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
1. Write your answers in this README.md file. Do not delete the questions. Write your answers after the `>`. If you need to write more than one paragraph, add more `>`.

## Instructions

Do your best to answer the questions with specific details when required fully. Writing about code clearly and thoroughly is a critical skill to practice. 

- Which one did you choose? Provide the name and base URL

> https://developer.edamam.com/

- What purpose is this API for (education/fun and games/information/etc.)?

> The purpose of this API is to allow you to search through millions of web recipes and integrate this information into your mobile or web applications.

- What is the URL of the documentation?

> http://https://api.edamam.com/api/recipes/v2

- What is the full URL of one endpoint?

> http://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api

- What is a sample of the data from the endpoint (copy and paste results from Postman, ok to shorten if itâ€™s over 100 lines)? Be sure to wrap your answer in the correct formatting for code/JSON.

```json 
<!-- Start of edamamhelp Zendesk Widget script -->
		<script id="ze-snippet" src="https://static.zdassets.com/ekr/snippet.js?key=c3c17823-b543-44d2-886d-3e2e2e271de9"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript">

```

- What status code did you get back?

> 200 OK

- Click on the **response** headers in Postman. What are the `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` (provide exact values)?

> `Content-Type` text/html; charset=utf-8

> `Content-Length`  1034

- Summarize the most salient parts of the data you are getting back (for example, Cat facts returns JSON that identifies the source of the cat fact, the cat fact, information about when the fact was created and updated, and the fact itself).

> The summary of the data is ... curl --location 'https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api'

- How could you use this data in an application?

> I could imagine integrating this API into an app that you can look up any food recipe in.

- What did you like about the documentation?

> The documentation was very descriptive and informtive.

- What did you find challenging about the documentation?

> I found the documentation challenging when putting it in the Postman API.

- Did the quality of the documentation impact your decision to use it?

> Yes/No because... Yes because, it seemed simple and straight to the point.

- Did you switch which API you chose initially because of its documentation, or did you stick with the one you selected and work your way through it?

> Yes/No I ended up ... Yes we ended up sticking with the one we originally chose, and worked through it, so we can get this lab done. 

- In your own words, summarize the request-response cycle.

> The request-response cycle ... is when the web browser sends a request to the server. The server then interacts with the database, and sends a response status.

- In your own words, describe what an API is.

> An API is ... how two applications communicate with each other using requests and responses. The API documentation has informatioonn on how developers should structure the requests and responses.

- In your own words, describe the purpose of Postman.

> Postman is an application that ... tests HTTP requests and is used to build and use API's. It simplifies collaborating with others to create better API's, at a faster rate as well.
